= Challenge Level 1

Once your app and model is deployed onto the robot and you have signaled the facilitators, they will temporarily disconnect your robot from the network.

**Your mission: Your robot must autonomously find the red fedora and drive towards it. The mission will count as accomplished when the robot is 20-30 cm away from the fedora.**

The playing field where the fedora and robot will be placed is defined inside these boundaries:

The time it takes your robot to navigate to the fedora will be taken by the facilitators and count toward your final points.

Once you little mechanical friend has completed his mission, you may continue to the next chapter.
