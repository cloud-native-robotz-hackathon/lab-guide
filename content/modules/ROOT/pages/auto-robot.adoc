= Deploy Control App to the Robot!

Now that your control application performs well enough, it's time to move on to the final stage of the hackathon: Have the robot run autonomously and measure the time it takes to accomplish the mission laid out in the final challenge!

Testing our solution from OpenShift DevSpaces is fun, but what we really want is an **autonomous robot** that can think for itself and find our fedora in the most disconnected of places. This means the controll app and the object detection service have to run locally on the robot.

You will have to provide your solution assets in the form of container images. It is time to package them and deploy them onto the robot itself.

== Build a Container Image of the Object Detection Model

Once we are finished with tuning our object detection model, we will package it into a container image to be deployed on the robot.

[IMPORTANT]
The pipeline will use the model `model/model-latest.onnx` in your S3 bucket for the build. So if you have switched from your custom model (`model-latest.onnx`) to our pretrained model (`model-custom-images.onnx`) you will need to go to the *S3 Browser* Workbench, download `backup/model-custom-images.onnx` and upload and replace `model/model-latest.onnx`.

== Build a Container Image of the Application

When you feel done with the app, it's time to package it in a Container Image as well.

TIP: Make sure you have pushed the latest version of your app into Gitea!

A matching pipeline has been added to your template app repository. This pipeline is triggered by the creation of a Tag in Gitea. Once you are ready, all you need to do is create a Tag and the Pipeline will build and push the Image to the local OpenShift Registry. Magical!

== Deploy your Images to the Robot with GitOps
Now that we have the images, we can deploy them to the robot. Since the robots are running Microshift (a lightweight version of OpenShift) we can use consistent tooling to automate our Deployment. We will use **OpenShift GitOps** based on ArgoCD for this.

A **OpenShift GitOps** project has already been setup that listens to changes of a configuration repository. The microshift of your robot as been added as manged cluster so any change in the repo will be rolled out diretcly to your robot. All you need to do is update the configuration code in Gitea.

Have a look at the Git repo : {gitea_console_url}/{user}/robot-gitops[robot-gitops, window=_blank]

* The object detection image needs to be set here:
** {gitea_console_url}/{user}/robot-gitops/src/branch/main/base/namespace/triton/deployment.yaml[robot-gitops/src/branch/main/base/namespace/triton/deployment.yaml, window=_blank]
*** Click on the pen icon on the top right to edit the file
*** In the resource yaml look for the field `image:` with the value
+
[source,text]
----
quay.io/cloud-native-robotz-hackathon/model-container:trained
----

*** Replace the value with
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
default-route-openshift-image-registry.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{user}-ai/model-container:latest
----
*** Click on the **Commit Changes** Button at the very bottom

* The app image needs to be set here:
** {gitea_console_url}/{user}/robot-gitops/src/branch/main/base/namespace/robot-app/deployment.yaml[robot-gitops/src/branch/main/base/namespace/robot-app/deployment.yaml, window=_blank]
*** Click on the pen icon on the top right to edit the file
*** In the resource yaml look for the field `image` with the value
+
[source,text]
----
quay.io/cloud-native-robotz-hackathon/starter-app-python:master
----

*** Replace the value with
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
default-route-openshift-image-registry.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/{user}-dev/starter-app-python:v1
----

*** Click on the **Commit Changes** Button at the very bottom

TIP: In real world projects, you would use a tool such as **Kustomize** to add modification layer without changing the actual deployment.yaml files

Once you commit the changes **OpenShift GitOps** will start to work on the deployment.

=== Check OpenShift GitOps / ArgoCD rollout

Login into OpenShift GitOps / ArgoCD:

* Open: https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[OpenShift GitOps/ArgoCD, window=_blank]
* Click **"LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT"**
+
image::argocd-login.png[width=450px]
* Username:
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----
* Password :
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}
----
* Click **Allow selected permissions**
* Now you can follow the rollout, this is the entry view:
+
image::argocd-overview.png[width="600px"]

If you click the tile, you'll get a detailed view of your GitOps rollout:

image::argocd-detail.png[width="600px"]

**But the outcome is clear**: The control application and the image detection model are running as containers locally on your robot, enabling autonomous robot operations.

== Start the Robot

As the app is now running locally on the robot, you won't get access to the web UI of the app. It's an edge device after all... ;-)

But we need a way to call **Initiate Run** and **Emergency Stop** like you did before from the web UI. Here good old `curl` comes to the rescue.

To start the robot, go to your Dev Spaces VSCode session and open a terminal. In the terminal execute the following command to initiate a run:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
include::partial$export-{user}.adoc[]

curl -X POST -H "Host: starterapp-python-robot-app.apps.${ROBOT_NAME}" http://${ROBOT_NAME}.robot.svc.cluster.local:80/run
----

Your robot should now execute your code and start moving. If you want to check the output of your control app, you can do this in OpenShift GitOps. Go to your ArgoCD UI again and click the box representing your app (`starterapp-python-....`) to the left. In the next view choose the **LOGS** tab:

image::argocd-app.png[width="600px"]

After a short delay the output of your app will show up in the window, same as what you are used to from developing the app in Dev Spaces:

image::argocd-logs.png[width="600px"]

To stop your robot you can call the stop endpoint in the same way as you just run it:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
include::partial$export-{user}.adoc[]

curl -X POST -H "Host: starterapp-python-robot-app.apps.${ROBOT_NAME}" http://${ROBOT_NAME}.robot.svc.cluster.local:80/stop
----


== Expected outcome of this chapter

After this chapter:

* You have used GitOps to deploy your containerized app and AI model to the robot Microshift
* Your robot is now able to run as an autonomous edge device, while being easily updatable with new versions of your app and model

That's it, you have succesfully run a full DevOps and MLOps Deployment Lifecyle all the way to the Edge using OpenShift and Kubernetes paradigms.

== Next Steps

Now off to the final, go to the next chapter to learn how to prove your robots capabilities in front of your peers!
