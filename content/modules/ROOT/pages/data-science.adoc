= Data Science

As Data Scientists, we have been given a task to provide a robot the understanding of what a red hat (a fedora) looks like, correctly identify it and act on the object detection. You will be fine tuning an object dection model from the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[YOLO-family,window=_blank] (You Only Look Once), on a set of fedora images publicly available. To achieve this we will use **OpenShift AI**, an extension to OpenShift that provides a platform for Data Scientists to work with their favourite tools and libraries.

== Instantiate Workbench

Let's login into **OpenShift AI**

* Login into the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console,window=_blank] with:
** username:
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----
** password :
+
[source,text,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}
----

* Click *Skip tour*
+
image::skip-tour.png[width=420,align=left]

* Click on the top right menu with the squares and select **OpenShift AI** to access the **OpenShift AI Dashboard**
+
[.text-left]
image::rhoai-menu.png[width=350]

* Click on **Login with OpenShift**
* Login with the same credentials as before

This is the main Console where all Data Science related projects and assets are managed.

- In the left menu click on **Data Science Projects** to see all available Data Science Projects
- A project has already been prepared for you to work in
- Click on the project `{user}-ai`

As Data Scientists, we are in need of an interactive developement environment(IDE) to do our programming. One of the most common one (and provided by OpenShift AI) is JupyterLab. Let's create a new JupyterLab Workbench in our Data Science project and get started:

* Click on **Create Workbench**
* Enter these fields :
** **Name:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
fedora-detection
----

** **Notebook image**
*** Image selection: `Object Detection`

** **Deployment size**
*** Container size: 'Small'

** **Connections**
*** Click on **Attach existing connections**
**** Select `workbench-bucket` connection
+
image::attach-existing-connection.png[]
**** Click on **Attach**

* Click on **Create Workbench**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait until the **Status** of the Workbench is changed from "Starting" to "Running", this can take 2-3 minutes.

image::workbench-running.png[]
====

== Create your Model in JupyterLab

* Click on the Open link, next to the Workbench name link to open the JuypterLab Workbench
* Login with you OpenShift credentials and allow selected permissions

The first thing we notice when logging into our workbench is that it's quite empty. If this is your first time seeing JupyterLab, take a couple of minutes to look around! But don't worry, we are experienced Data Scientists who know the importance of documentation, version handling and reproducability. Therefore, in JuypterLab we are going to clone a complete JuypterNotebook to get started with our object detection project:

* In the menu on the left, click on the **Git** icon
* Click on **Clone a Repository**
* Enter the Git Url to the notebooks repo that has been prepared for you:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{gitea_console_url}/{user}/object-detection-notebooks.git
----

* Click on **Clone**
+
image::workbench-clone.png[width=420]

* On the left side in the menu click on the **Folder** icon.

Next, we will train our model on the basis of a https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolo5,window=_blank] Image Detection model to identify fedoras by providing sample images. The whole training process will run in a Pipeline leveraging OpenShift resource scaling. Sample images will be downloaded automatically and after the training, the model will be exported in onnx format to your S3 **ODF** (OpenShift Data Foundation) bucket. In this format we can deploy it to an inferencing service on **OpenShift AI** and serve it to our application.

=== Model Training

[NOTE]
====
When training the model the confidence score and accuracy will be a limiting factor going forward. In order to stay within hardware restrictions such as no GPUs in the data center and the physical robot, a compromise has been made in terms of the size of the base model as well as training epochs, batch size, number of images to train upon and how much time will be left on the hackathon for other tasks. Of course, these variables may be changed by you attendees, however, the changes such as increased epoch and increased sample count might yield little to no improvement while taking longer time to train.

This is a limiting factor edge cases face, finding the balance between accuracy and sizing requirements for the model to run.

Therefore, have some realistic expectations on the model and dont get hooked up on fine tuning it.

If we accept this, lets go ahead and train the model!
====

* In JupyterLab navigate to the directory `object-detection-notebooks/model-training`.

Notice that we now have a couple of python scripts containing code to execute the individual steps of the pipeline, a `configuration.yaml` file as well as pipeline definition itself. By clicking on the different scripts, you can view and edit them in your IDE. However, we are specifically interested in the pipeline definition, so let's open it:

* Double click on `model-training-cpu.pipeline`

This will show you a view of our Data Science Pipeline. This pipeline runs several steps / Python scripts in sequence to train our model. Again you don't have to change anything here but feel free to have a look at the steps by clicking on them.

Here is a quick explanation what each step of the Pipeline does:

* Step 1 : Downloads a set of sample images with labels and coordinates for our fedora class from the https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html[OpenImages website,window=_blank].
+
image::open-images.png[]

TIP: If you want to see the collection the model training is pulling images from, go to above website, click "Explore", set the **Type** to **Detection** and the **Class** to **Fedora**.

* Step 2 : Prepares the class labels and training sets
* Step 3 : Runs the actual training on a https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolo 5,window=_blank] Model
* Step 4 : Converts the model format to onnx
* Step 5 : Uploads it to an ODF S3 bucket

The pipeline can be configured to download and train on a specifc image object class such as  Fedoras, which is want we want.

* To configure a class, open the file called `configuration.yaml`.

You will see that an image class is already defined ('Laptop',). Looking for a new Laptop is great but we want to find red hats today.

* Change the `names` array to look like this

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
names: ['Fedora',]
----
* Save the file by pressing **ctrl+s** on Linux/Windows or **Command+s** on Mac

This image class is now mapped to the class number 0.

* Now back in the `model-training-cpu.pipeline`, on the top menu on the left click on the play icon
+
image::start-pipeline.png[]

* Keep the default settings and click on **OK**

* Click on **OK** at the *Job submission to Data Science Pipelines succeeded* dialog

This will submit the pipeline to OpenShift to run the training

* Switch to the *OpenShift AI* tab in your browser
* Select your Data Science Project {user}-ai
* Select **Pipelines** tab
* Expand the **model-training-cpu** Pipeline by clicking on the **>**
* Click on **View runs**
+
image::view-runs.png[]

* Click on **model-training-cpu-xxxxx** at the Run column
+
image::view-runs2.png[]

This will show the running steps of the pipeline

image::running-pipeline.png[]

With the default settings, the Pipeline will run around 15 minutes.  Let's use the time to deploy another Workbench that we can use to inspect our S3 bucket and see our model when ready.

== Deploy S3 Browser

* In the left menu click on **Data Science Projects** to see all available Data Science Projects
* A project has already been prepared for you to work in
* Click on the project `{user}-ai`
* In your project go on the tab **Workbenches**
* Click on **Create workbench** and enter these values
** **Name:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
s3-browser
----
** **Notebook image**
*** Image Selection: `S3 Browser`

** **Connections**
*** Click on **Attach existing connections**
**** Select `workbench-bucket` connection
+
image::attach-existing-connection.png[]
**** Click on **Attach**

* Click on **Create Workbench**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait until the **Status** of the Workbench is changed from "Starting" to "Running", this can take 2-3 minutes.

image::workbench-running-s3.png[]
====

* Click on the Open link, next to the Workbench name link to open the JuypterLab Workbench
* Login with your OpenShift credentials and allow selected permissions
* Accept the disclaimer

The browser will show you the contents of your bucket.  Except for a folder called `backup` that contains some backup models, it will look fairly empty before the pipeline finishes.

Now is a good time to grab some coffee, or if you are curious read up on the architecture and requirements of the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolov5 model family,window=_blank]. There are different sizing versions of the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolov5,window=_blank] and compute requirements. In the pipeline start form you could actually change the model version, and while the pipeline is at the model training step, you can see the loss functions in the logs.

Once the pipeline has run (Check the run) successfully the final model named latest-version.onnx will be saved in your S3 bucket. Have look in your S3 Browser. You should see a folder models with you models.

* Click on `models` and you see

== Model Serving
You now have a trained model for object recognition. To use the model we will deploy it into **OpenShift AI** Model Serving, which will make it available via an API.

=== Model Runtime

First we need to configure a model server:

* Click on **Data Science Projects** in the main menu on the left and make sure you have selected your `{user}-ai` again
* Select the tab **Models** and click on **Add model server**
* Model server name :
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ovms
----
* Serving runtime : `OpenVINO Model Server`
* Make deployed models available ... : `Check`
* Require token authentication : `Check`
** Service account name : `default-name`
* Keep the rest of the settings as is
* Click **Add**
+
image::serving-runtime.png[]

=== Deploy Model

* Under **Models and model servers** you'll see your new model server
* Click **Deploy model**
* In the form enter
** Model deployment name:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
fedora-detection-service
----
** Model framework (name-version): `onnx-1`
** Existing data connection: `workbench-bucket`
** Path:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
models/model-latest.onnx
----
** Click **Deploy**

[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait for the server to start. It may take a bit before the model server is able to answer requests. If you get an error in the following calls, just wait a few seconds and try again.
====

== Model Testing

Now it's time to finally test the model. And since we are Data Scientists here, we'll run the first tests to see how the model is performing in our JupyterLab Workbench.

* Copy the inference endpoint URL that is published through an OpenShift Route (and save it somewhere)
+
image::copy-inference-url.png[]
+
image::copy-inference-url2.png[]

* Copy the token of the endpoint
+
image::copy-token.png[]

* Back in your JupyterLab Workbench in the `object-detection-notebooks` directory, open the `online-scoring.ipynb` notebook
* Look for the variables `prediction_url` and `token`
+
[source,python]
----
prediction_url = 'REPLACE_ME'
token = 'REPLACE_ME'
----
* Paste the inference endpoint URL and the token you copied before into the placeholders

* Run the full notebook (the button with the two play icons in the top menu)
+
image::run-full-notebook.png[]

* Confirm to **Restart the Kernel**

You will see any identified classes with bounding boxes and confidence score at the end of the notebook.

You can test your model with different images in the `sample-images` folder, or even better, you can upload your own images. Take some pictures with your laptop or smartphone of a the fedora on the floor and upload them into the `sample_images` folder. Make sure you adjust the image name in `image_path` variable before running the notebook again AND that the format of the images you take is set to square resolution. This can be adjusted in most smartphones today. If you dont use square resolution, the printed bounding boxes may be drawn in the wrong areas of the pictures.

[TIP]
====
If you see multiple bounding boxes over your fedoras, that means you may need to filter out object detections with a lower score. By default the code filters out anything with a lower confidence score that 0.3. Search for the code `+conf_thres=0.3+`. Increase the threshold here by changing the value and rerun your Notebook.
====

That's it. It is finally time to handoff your amazing AI Fedora Detection service to the dev team. Make a note and use the two values `prediction_url` and `token` in your app in the next chapter.

== Optional: What if your Model does not perform that well?

As we are in a Hackathon environment and we don't have that much time we are using a quick approach to show you the basics of model training.  For a production environment you would rather use images of actual Fedoras to train the model and not random ones sitting on peoples heads.

If you run into any issues later on with the model not detecting Fedoras or identifiying other objects as Fedoras, we have a professionally trained model with custom images and more epochs prepared for you.

[IMPORTANT]
For the moment just test your own model, but if you do need to switch you can always come back here and deploy the other model like this:

* In your S3-Browser have a look at in the folder `/backup`. You should see a pretrained model called `model-custom-images.onnx`
* In your DataScience Project, go to *Models* > *Deployed Models* and click on the 1, *Edit* to the right
* Just change the the Path
** **Path:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
backup/model-custom-images.onnx
----
* Wait a few seconds until the new model is deployed
* Now you should get more precise predictions


== Expected outcome of this chapter

After this chapter you should know:

* how to train and test an AI model in OpenShift AI
* how to make your model available for inferencing using the model server
