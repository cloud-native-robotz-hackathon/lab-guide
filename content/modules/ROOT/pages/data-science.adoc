= Data Science

As Data Scientists, we have been given a task to provide a robot the understanding of what a red hat (a fedora) looks like, correctly identify it and act on the object detection. You will be fine tuning an object detection model from the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[YOLO-family,window=_blank] (You Only Look Once), on a set of fedora images we prepared for you. To achieve this we will use **OpenShift AI**, an extension to OpenShift that provides a platform for Data Scientists to work with their favourite tools and libraries.

== Instantiate Workbench

Let's login into **OpenShift AI**

As Data Scientists, we are in need of an interactive development environment (IDE) to do our programming. One of the most common ones (and provided by OpenShift AI) is JupyterLab. Let's create a new JupyterLab Workbench in our Data Science project and get started:

* Click on **Create Workbench**
* Enter these fields :
** **Name:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
fedora-detection
----

** **Notebook image**
*** Image selection: `Object Detection`

** **Deployment size**
*** Container size: 'Small'

** **Cluster storage**
*** Click on **Attach existing storage**
**** Select `object-detection-training-pvc` connection
**** **Standard Path**
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
object-detection-training-pvc
----
+
image::attach-existing-storage.png[]
**** Click on **Attach storage**
** **Connections**
*** Click on **Attach existing connections**
**** Select `workbench-bucket` connection
+
image::attach-existing-connection.png[]
**** Click on **Attach**

* Click on **Create Workbench**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait until the **Status** of the Workbench is changed from "Starting" to "Running", this can take 2-3 minutes.

image::workbench-running.png[]
====

== Create your Model in JupyterLab

* Click on the Open link, next to the Workbench name link to open the JupyterLab Workbench

The first thing we notice when logging into our workbench is that it's quite empty. If this is your first time seeing JupyterLab, take a couple of minutes to look around! But don't worry, we are experienced Data Scientists who know the importance of documentation, version handling and reproducibility. Therefore, in JupyterLab we are going to clone a complete Jupyter Notebook to get started with our object detection project:

* In the menu on the left, click on the **Git** icon
* Click on **Clone a Repository**
* Enter the Git Url to the notebooks repo that has been prepared for you:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{gitea_console_url}/{user}/object-detection-notebooks.git
----

* Click on **Clone**
+
image::workbench-clone.png[width=420]

* On the left side in the menu click on the **Folder** icon.

Next, we will train our model on the basis of a https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolo5,window=_blank] Image Detection model to identify fedoras by providing sample images. The whole training process will run in a Pipeline leveraging OpenShift resource scaling.

We have provided sample images for training. After the training, the model will be exported in onnx format to your S3 **ODF** (OpenShift Data Foundation) bucket. In this format we can deploy it to an inferencing service on **OpenShift AI** and serve it to our application.

=== The Training Images

To stay in the boundaries of the resources available to us, we provide around 100 images of a Red Hat Fedora together with the label metadata to train our base model with.

[NOTE]
====
Labeling in object detection is the annotation of raw image by humans, where bounding boxes are drawn around specific objects and assign a class label (e.g., "car", "person," "tree". Or "fedora"...) to each object. This basically teaches the base model to recognize a new class of objects.
====

Since we deliberately don't have a lot of variations in the images this will lead to a model that will recognize this particular Fedora pretty well, but not one that deviates slightly. This is commonly called "overfitting" and usually avoided, but in our case for demo and fun it's fine.

If you would like to get an idea what the images look like, in your JupyterLab Notebook navigate to the folder `object-detection-training-pvc/custom_training_images/fedora/images/` and open some of the images. You'll see slight variations of a Red Hat Fedora in front of varying backgrounds.

image::training-image.png[]

Labeling data in the form of a bounding box around the object in question "tells" the model during training what part of the image is actually the Fedora. This data is kept in a different folder; if you go to the folder `labels` you'll see text files, each corresponding to one of the images. If you open one of the label files, there are coordinates of a rectangle that describe the bounding box.

=== Model Training

[NOTE]
====
When training the model the confidence score and accuracy will be a limiting factor going forward. In order to stay within hardware restrictions such as no GPUs in the data center and the physical robot, a compromise has been made in terms of the size of the base model as well as training epochs, batch size, number of images to train upon and how much time will be left on the hackathon for other tasks. Of course, these variables may be changed by you attendees, however, the changes such as increased epoch and increased sample count might yield little to no improvement while taking longer time to train.

This is a limiting factor edge cases face, finding the balance between accuracy and sizing requirements for the model to run.

Therefore, have some realistic expectations on the model and don't get hooked up on fine tuning it.

If we accept this, let's go ahead and train the model!
====

* In JupyterLab navigate to the directory `object-detection-notebooks/model-training`.

Notice that we now have a couple of python scripts containing code to execute the individual steps of the pipeline, a `configuration.yaml` file as well as pipeline definition itself. By clicking on the different scripts, you can view and edit them in your IDE. However, we are specifically interested in the pipeline definition, so let's open it:

* Double click on `model-training-cpu.pipeline`

This will show you a view of our Data Science Pipeline. This pipeline runs several steps / Python scripts in sequence to train our model. Again you don't have to change anything here but feel free to have a look at the steps by clicking on them.

Here is a quick explanation what each step of the Pipeline does:

* Step 1 : Prepares the class labels, images and bounding box coordinates as training sets
* Step 2 : Runs the actual training on a https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolo 5,window=_blank] Model
* Step 3 : Converts the model format to onnx
* Step 4 : Uploads it to an ODF S3 bucket

Now back in the `model-training-cpu.pipeline`, on the top menu on the left click on the play icon

image::start-pipeline.png[]

* Keep the default settings and click on **OK**

* Click on **OK** at the *Job submission to Data Science Pipelines succeeded* dialog

This will submit the pipeline to OpenShift to run the training

* Switch to the *OpenShift AI* tab in your browser
* Select your Data Science Project {user}-ai
* Select **Pipelines** tab
* Expand the **model-training-cpu** Pipeline by clicking on the **>**
* Click on **View runs**
+
image::view-runs.png[]

* Click on **model-training-cpu-xxxxx** at the Run column
+
image::view-runs2.png[]

This will show the running steps of the pipeline

image::running-pipeline.png[]

With the default settings, the Pipeline will run around 15 minutes.  Let's use the time to deploy another Workbench that we can use to inspect our S3 bucket and see our model when ready.

== Deploy S3 Browser

While the pipeline is running, let's deploy another Workbench to inspect our S3 bucket. Make sure you're still in your `{user}-ai` project:

* In your project, go to the tab **Workbenches**
* Click on **Create workbench** and enter these values
** **Name:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
s3-browser
----
** **Notebook image**
*** Image Selection: `S3 Browser`

** **Connections**
*** Click on **Attach existing connections**
**** Select `workbench-bucket` connection
+
image::attach-existing-connection.png[]
**** Click on **Attach**

* Click on **Create Workbench**
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait until the **Status** of the Workbench is changed from "Starting" to "Running", this can take 2-3 minutes.

image::workbench-running-s3.png[]
====

* Click on the Open link, next to the Workbench name link to open the S3 Browser
* Accept the disclaimer

The browser will show you the contents of your bucket.  Except for a folder called `backup` that contains some backup models, it will look fairly empty before the pipeline finishes.

Now is a good time to grab some coffee, or if you are curious read up on the architecture and requirements of the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolov5 model family,window=_blank]. There are different sizing versions of the https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov5/[Yolov5,window=_blank] and compute requirements. In the pipeline start form you could actually change the model version, and while the pipeline is at the model training step, you can see the loss functions in the logs.

Once the pipeline has run successfully (check the run status), the final model named `model-latest.onnx` will be saved in your S3 bucket. Check your S3 Browser. You should see a folder called `models` with your model.

* Click on `models` to see your model

== Model Serving
You now have a trained model for object recognition. To use the model we will deploy it into **OpenShift AI** Model Serving, which will make it available via an API.

=== Model Runtime

First we need to configure a model server:

* Click on **Data Science Projects** in the main menu on the left and make sure you have selected your `{user}-ai` again
* Select the tab **Models**
* Choose **Multi-model serving platform** by clicking **Select multi-model**
* Now deploy a model server by clicking **Add model server**

==== Fill out the form.

* **Model server name:**
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
ovms
----
* **Serving runtime**: `OpenVINO Model Server`
* **Accelerator**: `None`
* **Model route**
** ☑︎ Make deployed models available through an external route: `Check`
* **Token authentication**
** ☑︎ Require token authentication : `Check`
** **Service account name** : `default-name`
* Click **Add**

.**Click to reveal the screenshot**

image::serving-runtime.png[]
====

=== Deploy Model

* Under **Models and model servers** you'll see your new model server
* Click **Deploy model**
* In the form enter
** Model deployment name:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
fedora-detection-service
----
** Model framework (name-version): `onnx-1`
** Existing data connection: `workbench-bucket`
** Path:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
models/model-latest.onnx
----
** Click **Deploy**

[IMPORTANT]
====
Wait for the server to start. It may take a bit before the model server is able to answer requests. If you get an error in the following calls, just wait a few seconds and try again.
====

== Model Testing

Now it's time to finally test the model. And since we are Data Scientists here, we'll run the first tests to see how the model is performing in our JupyterLab Workbench.

* Copy the inference endpoint URL that is published through an OpenShift Route (and save it somewhere)
+
image::copy-inference-url.png[]
+
image::copy-inference-url2.png[]

* Copy the token of the endpoint
+
image::copy-token.png[]

* Back in your JupyterLab Workbench in the `object-detection-notebooks` directory, open the `online-scoring.ipynb` notebook
* Look for the variables `prediction_url` and `token`
+
[source,python]
----
prediction_url = 'REPLACE_ME'
token = 'REPLACE_ME'
----
* Paste the inference endpoint URL and the token you copied before into the placeholders

* Run the full notebook (the button with the two play icons in the top menu)
+
image::run-full-notebook.png[]

* Confirm to **Restart the Kernel**

You will see any identified classes with bounding boxes and confidence score at the end of the notebook.

You can test your model with different images in the `sample-images` folder, or upload your own images. Take some pictures with your laptop or smartphone of the fedora on the floor and upload them into the `sample_images` folder. Make sure you adjust the image name in the `image_path` variable before running the notebook again AND that the format of the images you take is set to square resolution. This can be adjusted in most smartphones today. If you don't use square resolution, the printed bounding boxes may be drawn in the wrong areas of the pictures.

[TIP]
====
If you see multiple bounding boxes over your fedoras, that means you may need to filter out object detections with a lower score. By default the code filters out anything with a lower confidence score that 0.3. Search for the code `+conf_thres=0.3+`. Increase the threshold here by changing the value and rerun your Notebook.
====

And that's it for the data science part. It is finally time to handoff your amazing AI Fedora Detection service to the dev team. Make a note and use the two values `prediction_url` and `token` in your app in the next chapter.
