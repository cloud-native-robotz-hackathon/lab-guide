== Start Coding in Dev Spaces

To develop our flashy AI enhanced app we will use **OpenShift Dev Spaces**, a web IDE that comes with every OpenShift installation. No need to setup IDEs, runtimes and tools on your laptop.


* If you are not already logged in, login into the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console,window=_blank] with:
** username: {user}
** password : {password}

* In the OpenShift Console on the top right, click on the square icon and select **Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces**
* Login with your OpenShift credentials
* Give permissions if required

Next we are going to start a new Workspace where all the editing is done and we will initialize it with a **DevFile**.  A https://devfile.io/[DevFile] is a definition for environment, tooling, settings and runtimes for our development workspace. No more endless installations and configurations. We will be  ready to hack right away. Since a matching **DevFile** is already checked into out Git repo, we can use it directly to initialize a workspace.

* Select **Create Workspace** in the left menu
* Enter **Git Repo URL** :
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{gitea_console_url}/{user}/starter-app-python/raw/branch/master/devfile.yaml
----

TIP: You can find the url to the DevFile manually by opening your {gitea_console_url}[Gitea,window=_blank], navigate to the repo `starter-app-python` and then `devfile.yaml`. Click on "Originalversion / Raw" and
copy the URL

* Click on **Create and Open**

Wait for the Workspace to deploy (this may take some time). Once you Workspace is up an running you should see a view that looks familiar if you have used VSCode before.

We have prepared some sample code that you can use to quickly get started with your app. We will clone the repo next.

* If you see a Popup asking you to "Do you trust the authors", click check **Always ...**  and click **Yes ...**

Next we will clone the starter code for our robot control app into our workspace.

* On the left side click on the button **Clone Repository**
* In the form at the top enter the git url
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
{gitea_console_url}/{user}/starter-app-python.git
----
* Hit **Enter**
* In the next form keep the path as is ( /projects ) and hit **Enter** again
* In the next dialoge select **Open** to reopen the Browser tab in this project

Your will see the starter code on the left side.

=== Start the App

You have 2 options to run th app. You can either use a task that is defined in the **DevFile** and runs all the pip and python commands under the hood. Or you can open a terminal and run these commands yourself, to have full control.

==== Option 1 : Starting the App through the Workspace Task

* In the top left click on the "hamburger" menu > **Terminal** > **Run Task ...**
* In the selection menu at the top, click on **devfile**
* Then click on **devfile: Run the application**

This will install the python dependencies and start the webserver of your app. Please proceed to chapter **Open the App Website**


=== Option 2: Starting the App from the Terminal

We will need to install a couple of python dependencies with pip.

* Open a Terminal by clicking the “Hamburger Icon” > **Terminal** > **New Terminal** in the top left

In the terminal enter :

TIP: Depending on your browser you may need to allow pasting into the Terminal via a PopUp

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd starter-project-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.local/bin
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app --reload
----

=== Open the App Website

**Important** : Once gunicorn is starting you will see two Popups in the bottom right corner that you will need to approve. These will publish a Route in OpenShift through which you can reach the website of your app running the the Workspace

* Click on **Yes**

image::devspaces-allow_route.png[]

* Click on **Open in new tab**

image::devspaces-open-new-tab.png[]

* Click on **Open*

image::devspaces-open-tab.png[]

A new Browser tab with the web interface of the Robot Control app will open. Make sure you are on http:// if the page does not open

TIP: If you have missed one of the PopUps, just stop and restart gunicorn with Strg-C and rerunning the last Task or command.

The website features a **Run** button that you can use to execute your code.

Now let's connect our app to the object detection service. Edit the `config.yaml` to add your inferencing endpoint that you created in the previous chapter.

Replace the following placeholders:

* <REPLACE_WITH_ROBOT_API> : `http://hub-controller-live.red-hat-service-interconnect-data-center.svc.cluster.local:8080/robot`
* <REPLACE_WITH_ROBOT_NAME> : The lowercase name of your Robot e.g. `terminator`
* <REPLACE_WITH_INFERENCING_API> (The Object Detection Service from the previous chapter)
* <REPLACE_WITH_INFERENCING_API_TOKEN> (The Token of the Object Detection Service from the previous chapter)

Next let's write some code

* Open the file `app.py` and look at the commented out code samples
* Start to code by writing a robot command to drive your robot forward a few units
* Call the run function by clicking on the **Run** button on the app website

=== The Robot API

The robot Restful API is fairly simple:

* POST /forward/<length>
** Drive forward by length
* POST /backward/<length>
** Drive backwards by length
* POST /left/<degrees>
** Turn left by degrees
* POST /right/<degrees>
** Turn right by degrees
* GET /image
** Returns a base64 image of the current camera image
* GET /status
** Returns the status of the robot
* GET /power
** Returns the current power of the robot

For testing purposes you can call the Robot API directly from you Workspace Terminal with curl. Make sure to replace <REPLACE_WITH_USER_KEY> with your Robot name.

To drive forward 10 units, call:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl -X POST -v http://hub-controller-live.red-hat-service-interconnect-data-center.svc.cluster.local:8080/robot/backward/10?user_key=<REPLACE_WITH_USER_KEY>
----

To retrieve a camera image and save it as a file:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
curl -v http://hub-controller-live.red-hat-service-interconnect-data-center.svc.cluster.local:8080/robot/camera?user_key=<REPLACE_WITH_USER_KEY> | base64 -d > image.jpg
