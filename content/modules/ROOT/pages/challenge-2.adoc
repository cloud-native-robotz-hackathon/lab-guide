= Challenge Level 2

Now let's put the super powers of your robot together and tackle a more challenging mission.

**Your mission: Your robot will be positioned in front of a barrier. It needs to drive around it, indentify the red fedora behind it and drive towards it, stopping roughly 20 cm before.**

The playing field will look like in the first challenge with a barrier added:

Taking into account the code from you previous missions, develop a solution for this navigation and detection sequence.

Let the facilitators know when you are ready for a run to take the time it takes your robot to arrive at the fedora.
