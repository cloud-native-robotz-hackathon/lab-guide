= Checkpoint Level 3

Excellent! Your robot can check his surroundings.

Let's put these super powers together an tackle a more challenging mission.

Your robot will be positioned in front of a barrier. It needs to drive around it, indentify the red Fedora behind it. Then it should drive towards ist, stopping roughly 50 cm before.

To make things more exciting, you robot will face off against another team.

Taking into account the previous missions, code a solution for this navigation and detection sequence.

Let the facilitators know when you are ready. As soon as a second team is available these little guys will face off.

The first robot to enter the Fedora perimeter gets 2 points, the second gets 1 point.
